The road is illuminated by streetlights and the headlights of surrounding vehicles. The ego vehicle is positioned in the left lane, following a line of cars ahead. The traffic appears moderate, with some vehicles slowing down at intersections. Pedestrians are visible on the sidewalks, walking or standing near the curb. Traffic signs and lights are present but not clearly visible due to the darkness. The overall atmosphere suggests a typical city night with moderate traffic and pedestrian activity.\n\n**Driving Parameters (JSON):**\n```json\n{\n  \"road_type\": \"urban\",\n  \"lane_count\": 2,\n  \"ego_lane_position\": \"left\",\n  \"traffic_light_state\": \"red\",\n  \"pedestrian_on_road\": \"yes\",\n  \"closest_vehicle_distance\": \"50 meters\",\n  \"ego_vehicle_speed\": \"slow\",\n  \"road_curvature\": \"straight\",\n  \"weather\": \"clear\",\n  \"visibility\": \"moderate\",\n  \"traffic_density\": \"moderate\",\n  \"risk_factor\": \"medium\"\n}\n```\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- **Nearby Vehicles:** The ego vehicle is following a line of cars ahead, which may be slowing down at intersections. This could lead to a potential collision if the ego vehicle does not maintain a safe distance.\n- **Pedestrians:** Pedestrians are visible on the sidewalks, which could pose a risk if they suddenly move into the path of the ego vehicle.\n- **Traffic Light State:** The traffic light is red, indicating that vehicles must stop. The ego vehicle should slow down and prepare to stop if necessary.\n- **Road Conditions:** The road is well-lit, but visibility is moderate due to the darkness. This could affect the driver's ability to see potential hazards.\n- **Traffic Density:** The traffic density is moderate, which means there is a risk of congestion and potential delays.\n- **Weather:** The weather is clear, which is generally good for driving, but the darkness can reduce visibility.\n\nOverall, the risk assessment indicates a medium level of risk due to the combination of moderate traffic, potential collisions with pedestrians, and reduced visibility. The ego vehicle should maintain a safe distance, slow down when necessary, and be prepared for potential changes in traffic conditions."

The traffic light ahead is red, indicating that vehicles must stop. There are no pedestrians visible on the road, but there are a few people standing near the sidewalk, possibly waiting to cross or observing the traffic.
