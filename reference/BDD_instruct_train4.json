The road appears to be wet, possibly due to recent rain, which could affect traction and visibility.\n\n**Driving Parameters (JSON):**\n```json\n{\n  \"road_type\": \"Urban Street\",\n  \"lane_count\": \"4\",\n  \"ego_lane_position\": \"Right Lane\",\n  \"traffic_light_state\": \"Green\",\n  \"pedestrian_on_road\": \"None\",\n  \"closest_vehicle_distance\": \"50 feet\",\n  \"ego_vehicle_speed\": \"20 mph\",\n  \"road_curvature\": \"Slight Curve\",\n  \"weather\": \"Rainy\",\n  \"visibility\": \"Good\",\n  \"traffic_density\": \"Moderate\",\n  \"risk_factor\": \"Medium\"\n}\n```\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- **Nearby Vehicles:** The ego vehicle is following a yellow taxi and a white van. Both vehicles are maintaining a safe distance, but the taxi is slightly ahead.\n- **Pedestrians:** No pedestrians are visible on the road.\n- **Road Conditions:** The road is wet, which can affect traction and braking distances. Visibility is good, but the wet surface may reduce grip.\n- **Traffic Density:** The traffic is moderate, with no significant congestion.\n- **Risk Factor:** The risk factor is medium. The wet road conditions and moderate traffic density increase the likelihood of hydroplaning or skidding, requiring cautious driving.\n\n**Actionable Observations for ADAS System:**\n- Maintain a safe distance from the yellow taxi and white van.\n- Be prepared for sudden stops or changes in traffic patterns.\n- Adjust speed according to road conditions and traffic density.\n- Use the turn signal to indicate lane changes.\n- Be vigilant for any potential hazards such as potholes or debris on the wet road."

            "a": "**Scene Description:**\n- The scene is set at a nighttime intersection with multiple traffic lights and street signs visible.\n- The traffic light ahead is red, indicating that vehicles must stop.\n- There are no visible vehicles in the immediate vicinity, suggesting a quiet intersection.\n- Pedestrians are not present on the road.\n- The road markings include a crosswalk and lane dividers.\n- The weather appears clear, with no signs of rain or snow.\n- Visibility is good, allowing for clear sightlines.\n\n**Driving Parameters (JSON):**\n```json\n{\n  \"road_type\": \"urban\",\n  \"lane_count\": 2,\n  \"ego_lane_position\": \"left\",\n  \"traffic_light_state\": \"red\",\n  \"pedestrian_on_road\": false,\n  \"closest_vehicle_distance\": \"unknown\",\n  \"ego_vehicle_speed\": \"0 mph\",\n  \"road_curvature\": \"straight\",\n  \"weather\": \"clear\",\n  \"visibility\": \"good\",\n  \"traffic_density\": \"low\",\n  \"risk_factor\": \"low\"\n}\n```\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- **Nearby Vehicles:** No vehicles are present in the immediate vicinity, so there is no risk of collision with other vehicles.\n- **Pedestrians:** No pedestrians are visible on the road, reducing the risk of pedestrian accidents.\n- **Traffic Light:** The red light indicates that the ego vehicle should stop, which is the correct action given the current situation.\n- **Road Conditions:** The road is clear with no visible obstacles, and the weather is clear, providing good visibility.\n- **Visibility:** Good visibility allows for clear sightlines and easy detection of any potential hazards.\n- **Traffic Density:** Low traffic density reduces the likelihood of sudden changes in traffic patterns.\n- **Risk Factor:** The overall risk factor is low as there are no immediate threats or obstacles to consider. The ego vehicle should proceed cautiously when the light turns green."
